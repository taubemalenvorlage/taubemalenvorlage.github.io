<p>Nothing changes on New Years day. New Years Day is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift taken from her sixth studio album Reputation 2017. I want to be with you be with you night and day. Theres glitter on the floor after the party Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor You and me from the night before but Dont read the last page But I stay when youre lost and Im scared and youre turning away I want your midnights But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi I can tell. It is believed that New Years Day initially started out as a love song dedicated to Bonos high-school sweetheart Ali whom he had recently married but this changed. Taylor Swifts new lyrics for her 10-minute version of All Too Well indicates her nine-year age gap with Jake Gyllenhaal was the reason for their breakup.</p>
