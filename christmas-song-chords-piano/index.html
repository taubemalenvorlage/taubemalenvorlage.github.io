<p>What Child is This while a hymn written in the 1800s is not overloaded with chord changes. Mariah and Bings songs both start on the tonic chord add a seventh on the second chord and move to the dominant on the third chord. Chords to for example Silent Night O Holy Night and The Christmas Song. This song was written in 1950 so its more modern than some of the traditional holiday songs. The chorus of Last Christmas follows a four-chord progression and utilizes four chords as noted above. At this point both songs move from that dominant chord to a lovely Christmassy diminished chord.</p>
