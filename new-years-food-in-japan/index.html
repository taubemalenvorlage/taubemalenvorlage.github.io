<p>Osechi is typically served on New Years Day in a beautiful lacquered box. The tradition goes back to the Heian period 794-1185 when Osechi was mainly served as an offering to New Years gods. It includes a set of beautifully decorated small dishes placed in specially designed boxes called jubako which are usually three to five levels high. Before the osechi box is opened on New Years Day many Japanese people turn to buckwheat noodles called そば on New Years Eve. With a history reaching back a thousand years the traditional New Years celebration is sprinkled with symbolism and that symbolism is particularly evident in typical New Years food. It symbolizes longevity as the noodles are long and never cut.</p>
