<p><strong>New Years Day Band Break Up</strong>. It also has multiple time signatures another of those bits of surprising complexity which makes me love the album so much. Yet it was a rocky road to Unbreakable as singer Ash Costello explains. Ashley Costellos contribution as a lead vocalist for the band has been exceptional. The band promoted themselves through MySpace.</p>

<p>These songs were heavily influenced by the members shared emotional experiences as Lohrbach Drover and Costello had all recently been through difficult relationship break-ups NYDs first bass player was Eric Seilo a mutual friend of the three although he had to. As I said it was a messy breakup with the band for me. Ill have you screaming when you. Their debut album My Dear followed in 2007. I instantly outgrew them. So break my body We crash collide Head on and the sparks ignite We burn we rage Going down down in flames Wont stop til the night is through This is how we do me and you So go on and break my body Break break Go on and break my body Break break Go on and break my body Cause were hell bent Dripping with sweat Back of my neck.</p>

<p>New Years Day 24 songs lyrics. The original lineup consisted of Ashley Costello vocals Mike Schoolden lead guitar backing vocals Keith Drover rhythm guitar keyboards backing vocals Adam Lohrbach bass backing vocals and Russell Dixon drums. The bands music is categorized as pop punk and alternative rock. As amusing as it may seem to be New Years Day band name was chosen as a symbol of the fresh start they all hoped and desired for as a band. I admit I am secretly happy Robert Smith looks dusty and sad in his same hair and make-up now he is in his 60s. It also has multiple time signatures another of those bits of surprising complexity which makes me love the album so much.</p>
